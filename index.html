    My name is Eric McElrea and I am currently a computer science teacher at Damien High School
    in La Verne, CA.  Check out my <a href="portfolio.html">portfolio page</a> to see some amazing projects I have created, or
    if you would like to know more about me, check out my <a href="aboutme.html">About Me</a> page! I'll leave you with
    one of my favorite quotes:
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    “For a long time it puzzled me how something so expensive, so leading edge, could be so useless.  And then it occurred to me that a computer is a stupid machine with the ability to do incredibly smart things, while computer programmers are smart people with the ability to do incredibly stupid things.  They are, in short, a perfect match.”
